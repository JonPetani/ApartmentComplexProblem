## Apartment Complex Webapp

Software Engineering Class Project

The principle is based around being able to allow candidate tenants to sign up for as many apartments they wish to rent and for that information to be seen by the owner of the apartment complex(s). The system is made to optimize rent collection and advertise which locations tenants can rent apartments from. Uses a Java Backend with use of the Hibernate framework + a REST API and Front-end is implemented using Angular JS and HTML/CSS/JS.
